                    the innovative concept of a neobank required a fundamental mindset shift.
                    Second, the project was plagued by <b>vague requirements</b>, with only a
                    directive for a \"futuristic\" design in yellow and grey, leaving the
                    team to interpret and visualise an undefined concept. Finally, the
                    <b>tight three-month deadline</b> added immense pressure, demanding a flawless
                    execution while ensuring the project's momentum continued even after my
                    planned departure for higher education.`

                    the company. I aimed to create a culture where every member had a voice in
                    advocating for the customer, driving a collaborative effort towards a user-
                    centric solution.<br/><br/>
                    To navigate the challenge of a newly formed design team, we embraced design 
                    sprints to run in a fast, transparent, and user-focused way.<br/><br/>
                    With my departure looming in three months, I proposed a plan focused on
                    clarity: tackle a challenging yet achievable project by refreshing the
                    interaction experience and visual design system.`
